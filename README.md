# word-bank-chrome
This is a repository for a chrome extension version of the word bank application

Problem: When watching a TV, listening to a podcast, or reading a file in a foreign language you come across words that you don't know. Then you have to either make a list of word you don't know, or navigate to a different page to look up what the word means. This create a lot of starting and stopping and back and forth which can become tedious and take away from the language learning process.

Solution: The aim of this extension is to take away some of the back and forth of this process. It will provide an easy place where the user can just type unknown words into the extension where they will be saved in the "bank", this contents of which can be shown to them at the click of a button. The bank will also keep track of how many times the users puts a word into the bank. This will inform the reader of words that perhaps come up more often in frequency or that they might need to study more. The objective of this extensive is to smooth the process of collecting and looking up unknown words during foreign language learning. Later versions might include automatic word translation.

Components:
-text box to input words
-local storage of the words
-button that when clicked will display the list of words in the "bank" accompanied by how many times that word has been input
